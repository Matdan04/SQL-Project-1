# Comprehensive SQL Database Management for Employee and Departmental Data
This repository presents a series of SQL scripts and queries designed for sophisticated management and analysis of employee and departmental data. The project encompasses various aspects of SQL database manipulation, ranging from table creation and data insertion to complex queries and aggregations.

## Project Highlights:

  1. Table Setup: Creation of 'employees' and 'departments' tables with necessary constraints and relationships. Includes the implementation of NOT NULL constraints on critical fields to maintain data integrity.
  2. Data Preprocessing: Insertion of structured employee and department data into respective tables. This step sets the foundation for subsequent queries and analyses.
  3. Table Alteration and Data Update: Modification of the 'employees' table to introduce new fields and constraints, including a check on birth dates and renaming of columns for clarity.
  4. Data Insertion and Modification: In-depth manipulation of employee records to reflect promotions, salary updates, and title changes.
  5. Analytical Queries: Implementation of various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data, such as average salaries, top earners, and rank calculations within departments.
  6. Advanced Aggregations and Views: Creation of SQL views and complex aggregations to facilitate easy access to frequently needed data combinations and summaries.
  7. Salary Analysis: Special focus on salary-related queries, providing insights into the distribution and ranking of salaries across different job titles and departments.


This project effectively demonstrates the capability to manage and analyze complex relational data using SQL. It serves as an excellent reference for those looking to understand practical applications of SQL in real-world scenarios, particularly in human resources and departmental data management.
